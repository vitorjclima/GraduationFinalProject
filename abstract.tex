Systems and software has been launched as services Cloud Computing enviroment with one goal, scability. One system is described as scalable if mantains the efiency when there is a significant rise of quantity of resources and user quantity. In order to achieve scalability, is necessary avoid bottlenecks when running the system. The goal at this work is study scalability, since concepts of Cloud Computing. That includes realize studys about virtualization tools, load balancing, web servers, distribuited file systems, and others subjects. Were studied differents perfomance metrics for evaluate the models, such as : response time, capacity, and efficiency of system in general.
